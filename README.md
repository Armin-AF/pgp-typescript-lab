# TypesScript with React AddOn

## Task
The task is to create a basic React application for random users. You'll be working towards the `https://randomuser.me/api/` api that will return a random user (you can fetch directly from your frontend this time).

- The UI should display at least the users `address`, `age` and `name`.
- It should also be possible to change the name through a form input (but you don't have to make a post request, just simply update the name in the UI.)
  - in other words, make it possible to change the state of the name field.
- For each new load of the application, a new user should appear.
